Easily and automatically make more revenue from MailChimp by understanding customer preferences and behaviour. Requires WooCommerce and MailChimp.

== Description ==

Seg makes WooCommerce and MailChimp really work together. If you run an WooCommerce store and use MailChimp, you really need to use Seg; it will transform the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns in MailChimp. 

= What does Seg do? =

Seg for WooCommerce + MailChimp captures all your visitors behaviour from their email, web browsing and orders and turns that into rich profiles of their preferences for your categories & products, and how likely they are to respond to emails, offers and more. 

You can then create your campaign in MailChimp as normal, but you use Seg to target the right customers for your content based on a wide range of factors including:

 - How much money you want to make (we predict that too!) from your campaign
 - How relevant the content is to your customers (customers who have "shown an interest" vs. "love" category X)
 - Whether they've bought recently
 - Whether they've visited recently
 - And so much more. 

You can also:

 - See how much revenue and profit your MailChimp campaigns have made in detail
 - See your customers in real time and what they are doing on your website
 - See a detailed profile for every customer that has ever visited or bought from your store and what their preferences are
 - See exactly how you can improve your email marketing (through MailChimp), inlcuding how much money you could make
 - See your campaign performance over time via our email analytics system

Seg automatically does this for you:

 - Tracks all customers behaviour and orders
 - Protects you from over-emailing your customers (you set the limit)
 - Predicts the revenue you will make from a campaign (knowing individual customer's behaviours and preferences) so you can tailor the audience to make the most money
 - Rates each campaign (as 1-5 stars) so you can easily find the best campaigns and improve them / resend them / use for inspiration in the future

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Seg affordable? =

Totally. We charge monthly, with no commitment, based on your list size. Our aim is to help smaller businesses really leverage their email marketing lists in a way that is normally reserved for products 10 times (and more) the cost of Seg. [View the pricing options](http://getseg.com/pricing.html).

= What does the plugin do to my website? =

The plugin does two things. 

1. It installs tracking code on your woocommerce site to enable tracking of your customers (what they are looking at, adding to their basket and buying). 
2. It uploads to Seg all your customer and order history for analysis and profile generation.

= I've been running my WooCommerce store for sometime now, what about my old data? =

When you connect yor MailChmip account and install this plugin, Seg extracts all history about your customers and creates profiles for all your customers. Meaning you will be able to know: 

 - How much money you made, exactly, from every MailChimp campaign you've ever sent
 - Who your most valuable customers are
 - What category preferences your customers have (i.e. "Customers who love Category X")
 - And so much more.
